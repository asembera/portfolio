# Description of Repository

This repository is a portfolio of some of the projects I have made.
Many of them are made with React/React-Redux. Some are vanilla JS with HTML and CSS. 
There is also one Python project that I completed as part of a internship I had involving Python
used for image analysis.

The trading-card-game folder is an unfinished game I am making with React-Redux.
